Description: GerbMerge is a program that combines several Gerber
        (i.e., RS274-X) and Excellon files into a single set
        of files. This program is useful for combining multiple
        printed circuit board layout files into a single job.
        
        To run the program, invoke the Python interpreter on the
        gerbmerge.py file. On Windows, if you installed GerbMerge in
        C:/Python24, for example, open a command window (DOS box)
        and type:
            C:/Python24/gerbmerge.bat
        
        For more details on installation or running GerbMerge, see the
        URL below.
